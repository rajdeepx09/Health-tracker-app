Health Tracker dApp (Decentralized Application)
🌟 Project Vision
Health Tracker is a blockchain-powered decentralized application (dApp) designed to empower individuals to securely track and manage their personal health data. By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, we provide a transparent, immutable, and privacy-focused solution for personal health record keeping.

🔬 Core Features
Secure Health Logging: Privately store personal health metrics on the blockchain
Immutable Records: Ensure data integrity through blockchain technology
User-Controlled Data: Complete ownership and control of personal health information
Privacy-First Approach: Data remains encrypted and accessible only by the user
📊 Key Health Metrics Tracked
